# Food_Image_Recognition

Python program that utilizes the Microsoft Cognitive Service API to recognize details of food
This was used to make an iOS food logger app for MHacks

Note:  My group and I didn't manage to finish the complete version of the iOS app.  Because it was our first time working with swift, we ran into numerouse programming issues.  I hope to finish this later on in the year when I gain more knowledge of swift
